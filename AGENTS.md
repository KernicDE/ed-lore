# AGENTS.md — ed-lore / The GalNet Chronicle

> This file describes the project structure, conventions, and operational details for AI coding agents working on this repository.

## 1. Project Overview

This project is **"The GalNet Chronicle"** — an archive and knowledge system for *Elite: Dangerous* GalNet articles.

**Current state:**
- ~2,550 Markdown articles in `Archive/YYYY/MM/DD_slug.md` (in-game year/month/day)
- Entity profiles in `Entities/` (persons, factions, arcs, technologies, locations)
- Static website built with **Astro 6.2 + React 19**, deployed to **GitHub Pages**
- Data pipeline: `scripts/build_graph.py` → `lore_graph.json` → website

**Output:** ~2,240 static pages (articles, entities, arcs, timeline) deployed to `https://kernicde.github.io/ed-lore/`

**Article path convention:** `Archive/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>_<slug>.md`
- `YYYY` = in-game year (e.g. `3307`)
- `MM` = month (zero-padded)
- `DD` = day (zero-padded)
- `slug` = lowercased, underscores, no special chars

---

## 4. Article Data Format

Every article has YAML frontmatter followed by a blank line and the article body.

### Core fields (always present)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `uuid` | Deterministic UUIDv5 from `date + lowercase title` |
| `title` | Original headline |
| `slug` | URL-safe slug |
| `date` | In-game date `YYYY-MM-DD` (quoted string) |
| `source` | `"GitHub"` or `"API"` |

### Enrichment fields (added manually)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `summary` | 1–3 sentence summary of the article's content |
| `player_impact` | What pilots could do / did in this event |
| `persons` | List of named individuals (canonical full names) |
| `groups` | List of factions, corporations, political bodies |
| `locations` | List of star systems or significant places |
| `technologies` | List of named ships, weapons, gadgets |
| `topics` | Tags like `terrorism`, `diplomacy`, `corporate expansion` |
| `arc_id` | Single story-arc identifier (or omitted) |
| `related_uuids` | List of related article UUIDs |
| `modern_impact` | Why this still matters today |
| `legacy_weight` | 1–5 scale of long-term importance |
| `significance` | `low` / `medium` / `high` |

### Banned topics (remove unless explicitly legitimate)

`ship`, `sport`, `trade`, `construction`, `medicine`, `safety`, `treasure hunt`

Legitimate exceptions exist (e.g. `medicine` for Titan quarantine articles).

### Body characteristics

- Plain text / minimal Markdown
- No images, no inline links, no headings, no blockquotes
- Older GitHub-sourced files may have `*` bullet prefixes
- API-sourced bodies have HTML stripped

---

## 5. The Fetch Script (`fetch.py`)

**WARNING:** `fetch.py` is a **destructive-sync** script. It re-downloads and overwrites articles every run.

1. **GitHub Phase** — Scrapes `elitedangereuse/LoreExplorer` (`.org` files, years 3300–3306)
2. **API Phase** — Paginates Frontier's JSON API (`cms.zaonce.net`)
3. **Write Phase** — Writes to `Archive/YYYY/MM/DD_slug.md`

**DO NOT RUN** while enriching or editing articles, as it will overwrite your work.

---

## 6. Build Pipeline

### Step 1: Build the graph

```bash
python scripts/build_graph.py
```

This reads all articles in `Archive/` and entity files in `Entities/`, then writes `lore_graph.json` to the repo root.

**Critical:** The script handles `None`/null values in list fields safely:
```python
for g in fm.get("groups") or []:
```

### Step 2: Copy to website

```bash
cp lore_graph.json website/src/data/lore_graph.json
```

The Astro build reads from `website/src/data/lore_graph.json`, NOT from the repo root.

### Step 3: Build

```bash
cd website && pnpm build
```

Output goes to `website/dist/`.

### Step 4: Deploy

GitHub Actions deploys automatically on push to `main`. The workflow is in `.github/workflows/`.

---

## 7. Validation

```bash
python scripts/validate_enrichment.py
```

Checks:
- Required fields present (`summary`, `player_impact`)
- No duplicate persons/groups
- No banned topics
- No bad locations (sentence fragments)
- YAML parseable
- Arc consistency (warns for large arcs with empty `related_uuids`)

---

## 8. Article Enrichment Workflow

Articles dated before 3309 require manual enrichment. Start with the most recent unenriched files and work backwards.

### Rules
- **Read every file fully** before editing. No Python scripts, no batch processing, no guessing, no hallucination.
- **Skip already-enriched files** (those with `summary` and `player_impact` fields).
- Add fields: `summary`, `player_impact`, `persons`, `groups`, `locations`, `technologies`, `related_uuids` where appropriate.
- **Clean garbage auto-extraction:**
  - Remove `entities:` field entirely.
  - Remove sentence-fragment locations like `"With the"`, `"Our endeavour in"`.
  - Never put `"Thargoid"` as a location.
  - Deduplicate groups (e.g. `"Sirius Corp"` → `"Sirius Corporation"`).
  - Do **not** use `ACT` as an entity — it is a procedural taskforce, not a narrative entity.
- Fix `modern_impact` when it is clearly wrong.
- Use `ReadFile` to inspect each file, then `StrReplaceFile` with exact old text.
- Validate YAML after edits with `python scripts/validate_enrichment.py`.

### Deployment cadence

Deploy after every ~50 enriched files by committing and pushing `main`.

---

## 9. Entity Files

Entity profiles live in `Entities/` and are auto-generated stubs plus hand-curated enrichment.

**Auto-generated stubs** have this format:
```yaml
---
id: person-name
name: Person Name
type: person
first_seen_date: '3307-08-16'
last_seen_date: '3307-08-26'
mention_count: 3
---

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->
```

When new persons or groups are introduced in articles, the build script may create stubs. These can be enriched later with biographical details.

---

## 10. Git & GitHub

- Repository: `https://github.com/KernicDE/ed-lore.git`
- Branch: `main`
- The `gh` CLI is authenticated for user **KernicDE**
- GitHub Actions auto-deploys the website on every push to `main`

---
